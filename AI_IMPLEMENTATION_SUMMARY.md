### 3. Capacity Management âœ…
- **Industry Capacity Tracking**: Monitors available vs filled positions
- **Real-time Availability**: Filters internships based on remaining capacity
- **Utilization Metrics**: Tracks capacity utilization percentages
- **Constraint Satisfaction**: Prevents over-allocation of internship positions

### 4. Advanced Matching Algorithm âœ…
- **Hybrid Scoring**: 70% AI + 30% rule-based for robustness
- **Multi-factor Analysis**: Skills, education, location, sector, experience
- **Diversity Optimization**: Ensures variety in sectors and companies
- **Real-time Scoring**: Dynamic match percentage calculation

## Technical Implementation

### Storage-Friendly Design
```python
# Optimized for Railway free tier
- RandomForestRegressor(n_estimators=50)  # Lightweight
- TfidfVectorizer(max_features=500)       # Reduced memory
- Pickle model persistence               # Fast loading
- Compressed feature extraction          # Efficient processing
```

### API Endpoints
- `/api/ai-match` - Main AI matching endpoint
- `/ai-demo` - Interactive demonstration page
- Backward compatible with existing `/api/recommendations`

### Enhanced Data Model
```json
{
  "affirmative_action": {
    "rural_quota": 15,
    "sc_quota": 8,
    "st_quota": 4,
    "obc_quota": 12,
    "pwd_quota": 3
  },
  "industry_capacity": 100,
  "filled_positions": 12,
  "ai_match_score": 85.7
}
```

## Demonstration Features

### AI Demo Page (/ai-demo)
- Interactive form for candidate profile input
- Real-time AI matching demonstration  
- Visual match score display
- Detailed algorithm explanation
- Mobile-responsive design

### Test Results
```
ðŸ¤– AI Recommendations Found: 5

1. AI/ML Engineer Intern - Premium at Google India
   AI Match Score: 77.0%
   
2. Data Science Intern at Flipkart
   AI Match Score: 72.5%
   
3. IoT Engineer Intern at Bosch India
